# 2022_Data_Analytics_Final_Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze drinking water quality to determine if the quality of community's drinking water is correlated with certain demographic markers, such as income level.

### Why
Access to clean drinking water, free of chemicals and biological material, is a basic human right. In the United States, we take access to clean drinking water for granted. The lead in the drinking water in Flint, MI was a wake-up call that perhaps other communities are also dealing with sub-par water. 

### Question
Do communities with traditionally underserved demographics have access to clean drinking water?

### Team Communication 
We are utilizing the following channels for communication and co-working:
- Slack: for daily stand-ups and discussion or troubleshooting
- Microsoft OneNote: for project planning and note-taking
- Zoom: for co-working sessions

## Data
Data is being sourced from usgs.gov, epa.gov, and the US Census data (2010).
